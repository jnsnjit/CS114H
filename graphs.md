__G = {V,E}__ <br>
a graph contains two sets <br>
- a set of v vertices
- a set of e edges
- vertices are adgenct when they share an edge.

* simple path: path passes through a vertex only *once*.
* cycle: path that contains a loop from a point back to the same point.
* simple cycle: loop path that only passes through vertexs in path once.
* connect v disconnect path: all points have a path to each v multiple seperated pathes in a graph.
