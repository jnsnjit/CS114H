recursion:
repeat function until base condition is reached

what is 'memoization'?
basically, when using recursion, you can decrease
the call stack by creating a cache of information 
that you might know about how your recursive 
function works

lets say I know the first ten digits of the fibo seq,
if i can make the func remember that, then that is ten
function calls less.

n! / (n-k)!
4*3*2*1 / 2*1
